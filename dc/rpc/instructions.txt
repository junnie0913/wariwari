(1) Install rpcbind in your machine

sudo apt-get install rpcbind

(2) rpcinfo

(3) rpcgen -a -C add.x

(4) make -f Makefile.add

(5) To start server --> :-$ sudo ./add_server

To start client --> :-$ sudo ./add_client localhost 5 8

add.x:

numbers -> name of the structure which sends the
parameters to the server

ADD_PROG -> name of the program

ADD_VERS -> name of the program version

add(numbers) -> method that we are going to call
remotely. We pass the numbers structure as the parameter
to this method.


It will generate the following files.

add.h -> header file

add_client.c -> client program

add_clnt.c -> client stub

add_server.c -> server program

add_svc.c -> server skeleton

add_xdr.c -> XDR routines used by both the client and the server

Makefile.add -> Makefile
